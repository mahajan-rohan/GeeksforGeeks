/*
Sum of GP
Given n, a and r as the number of terms, first term and common ratio respectively of 
an Geometric Progression Series. Find the sum of the series upto nth term.

Example 1:
Input: 3 3 2
Output: 21
Explanation: Series upto 3td term is
3 6 12, so sum will be 21.

Example 2:
Input: 3 1 2
Output: 7
Example: Series upto 3rd term is 
1 2 4, so sum will be 7.

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function 
sum_of_gp() which takes n, a and r as input parameter and returns the sum of the series.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constranits:
1 <= n, a, r <= 10
