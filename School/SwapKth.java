/*
Swap kth elements
Given an array arr of size n, swap the kth element from the beginning with kth element from the end.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 8
k = 3
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output: {1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8}
Explanation:
3rd element from beginning is 3 and from end is 6.

Example 2:
Input:
n = 5
k = 2
arr[] = {5, 3, 6, 1, 2}
Output: {5, 1, 6, 3, 2}
Explanation: 
2nd element from beginning is 3 and from end is 1.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function 
swapKth() which takes integers n , k  and an array of integers arr of length n as 
input parameters and returns void. You have to modify the array itself in-place.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 106
-109 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
